# Final-Project

Robby Gold, Zhiyuan Hu, Lining Liu

Our project analyzes the city of Pittsburgh through the eyes of a kid. We each analyzed a dataset that we felt would apply to a child. The datasets and their links are as follows:

Robby's dataset: City of Pittsburgh Courts and Rinks (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-courts)

Zhiyuan's dataset: Allegheny County Park Facilities (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-park-facilities)
Parks (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks1)

Lining's datasets: Playground Equipment (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playground-equipment) 
City of Pittsburgh Playgrounds (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playgrounds)
