# Final-Project

Robby Gold, Zhiyuan Hu, Lining Liu

For our project, we decided to evaluate the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh through the eyes of a child. We first thought about what things a child would want most in a neighborhood, and we settled on three main ideas: Parks, Sports, and Playgrounds. We each found a dataset that was relevant to one of these categories and used that for our analysis and metric. The datasets and their links are as follows:

Robby's dataset: City of Pittsburgh Courts and Rinks (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-courts)

Zhiyuan's dataset: Allegheny County Park Facilities (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-park-facilities)
Parks (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks1)

Lining's datasets: Playground Equipment (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playground-equipment) 
City of Pittsburgh Playgrounds (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playgrounds)
